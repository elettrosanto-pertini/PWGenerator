# Password Generator and Encrypt/Decrypt
I built this extension because I felt like I needed it. It is definitely not complex.
Creates passwords. Encrypts/Decrypts texts using Vigenere cipher with a custom key.
The aphabet used in this project is the first 128 ASCII characters minus the commands (so 97 characters).

Basically one can encrypt a string and then copy-paste the encryption in a pw manager (which, I'm aware, also encrypts passwords of course, unless...).

Technically useless unless you are a bit paranoid. I find it useful.
