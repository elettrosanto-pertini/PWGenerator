# Password Generator and Crypt/Decrypt
I built it because I felt like I needed it, it is definitely not groundbreaking.
Creates passwords. Cripts/Decripts texts using Vigenere cipher with a custom key.
The aphabet used in this project is the first 128 ASCII characters minus the commands (so 97 characters).
Basically useless unless you are a bit paranoid. I find it useful.
